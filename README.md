# Predicting Forest Coverage with Neural Nets 

In this project, I used scikit learn to train and tune neural nets to predict forest coverage in wilderness areas in Colorado.

* [**Forest_Coverage_Neural_Net_Building.ipynb**](Forest_Coverage_Neural_Net_Building.ipynb) - Jupyter Notebook containing both the R code and the thought process behind the model building.<br>
* [**Forest_Coverage_Code_Only.py**](Forest_Coverage_Code_Only.py) - Python script with same code as the Jupyter notebook. <br>
* [**Trees**](Trees) - Contains tree images used in the Jupyter notebook
